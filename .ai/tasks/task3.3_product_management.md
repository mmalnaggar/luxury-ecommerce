## Description
Develop the dashboard UI and API endpoints for brands to create, read, update, and delete their products.

## Details
- Create a "Products" page within the dashboard.
- Display a table or list of the brand's existing products.
- Implement a "Create Product" form/modal with fields for name, description, price, stock, etc.
- Implement "Edit" and "Delete" functionality for each product.
- Create secure API endpoints to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.
- Ensure that brands can only manage their own products.

## Test Strategy
- As a brand user, navigate to the products page and view existing products.
- Create a new product and verify it appears in the list.
- Edit an existing product and confirm the changes are saved.
- Delete a product and verify it is removed.
- Attempt to access/modify another brand's products via the API and verify it is denied.
