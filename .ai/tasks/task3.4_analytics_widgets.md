## Description
Add UI components and data fetching for displaying key analytics, such as sales, top products, and visitor metrics.

## Details
- Create an "Analytics" page within the dashboard.
- Design and implement UI widgets for key metrics (e.g., total sales, orders, conversion rate).
- Add a chart to visualize sales over time.
- Display a list of the brand's top-selling products.
- Create API endpoints to fetch the necessary aggregated data for the analytics.

## Test Strategy
- As a brand user, navigate to the analytics page.
- Verify that the data displayed in the widgets is accurate.
- Check that the sales chart renders correctly.
- Confirm the list of top products is correct.
- Ensure brands can only see analytics for their own products.
