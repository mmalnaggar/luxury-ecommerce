## Description
Implement the UI and backend logic for a user to register their brand after signing up. This includes creating a new `Brand` record and associating it with the user.

## Details
- Create a new page/route for brand registration (e.g., `/brand/register`).
- This page should be protected, accessible only to logged-in users.
- Design a form to capture brand information (name, description, logo).
- Create an API endpoint to handle the form submission.
- The endpoint should create a `Brand` in the database and link it to the current user's ID.
- Upon successful registration, the user's role should be updated to `BRAND`.

## Test Strategy
- Verify unauthenticated users are redirected from the registration page.
- Successfully submit the brand registration form.
- Check the database to confirm the `Brand` record is created and linked to the user.
- Verify the user's role is updated in their session/token.
- Test form validation for missing or invalid data.
