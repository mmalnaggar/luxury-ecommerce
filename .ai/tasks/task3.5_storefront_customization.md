## Description
Create the UI and backend logic to allow brands to customize their public-facing storefront, including banners and featured products.

## Details
- Create a "Storefront" page within the dashboard.
- Allow brands to upload a banner image.
- Implement a feature to select and order a list of "featured products" to display on their public brand page.
- Create API endpoints to save these customization settings.
- Update the public-facing brand page to display the custom banner and featured products.

## Test Strategy
- As a brand user, navigate to the storefront customization page.
- Upload a new banner and verify it is saved and displayed on the public page.
- Select featured products and confirm they appear correctly on the public page.
- Ensure that customizations from one brand do not affect another.
