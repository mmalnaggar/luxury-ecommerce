### ⚠️ **Current Issue: Authentication Required**
The deployment is currently protected by Vercel authentication. This means:

- But access requires authentication through Vercel
- This is a security feature that can be disabled

### 🛠️ **How to Fix Authentication Issue**

#### Option 1: Disable Authentication (Recommended for Public Apps)
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `crusor`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
4. Disable **"Password Protection"** or **"Vercel Authentication"**
5. Save changes

#### Option 2: Add Environment Variables
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project: `crusor`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://crusor-cvzx9jzm4-mmalnaggars-projects.vercel.app
   ```

### 🎯 **What's Working**
