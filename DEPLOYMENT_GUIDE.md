### 🔧 Environment Setup

#### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Admin User (create this user after deployment)
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@luxury.com"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin123"
```

#### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database
npm run seed
```

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Prepare for Vercel
1. Ensure your code is in a Git repository
2. Create a `vercel.json` file (already exists)
3. Update environment variables in Vercel dashboard

#### Step 2: Deploy
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts and set environment variables
```

#### Step 3: Configure Database
- For production, use a PostgreSQL database (Vercel Postgres, Supabase, etc.)
- Update `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables
- Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

### Option 2: Railway

#### Step 1: Setup
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. Railway will automatically detect Next.js and deploy

#### Step 2: Database
- Railway provides PostgreSQL databases
- Update `DATABASE_URL` with Railway's PostgreSQL URL
- Run migrations after deployment

### Option 3: Netlify

#### Step 1: Build Configuration
Create `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

#### Step 2: Deploy
1. Connect repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `.next`
4. Add environment variables

## 🗄️ Database Migration

### Local to Production
1. **Export local data** (if needed):
```bash
npx prisma db pull
```

2. **Update schema for production**:
```prisma
// In schema.prisma, change datasource
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

3. **Deploy schema**:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Errors
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database connection
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

#### 3. Authentication Issues
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set
- Check `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches deployment URL
- Ensure admin user exists

#### 4. Image Loading Issues
- Verify images are in `public/images/` directory
- Check file permissions
- Ensure correct file paths in code

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### Performance Optimization
1. **Image Optimization**
   - Use Next.js Image component
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Consider CDN for images

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Add indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Consider read replicas for high traffic

3. **Caching**
   - Implement Redis for session storage
   - Add API response caching
   - Use CDN for static assets

### Monitoring
- Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- Implement analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible)
- Monitor database performance
- Track user behavior

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment
