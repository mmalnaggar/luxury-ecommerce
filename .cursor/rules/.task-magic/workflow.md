# Task Magic Workflow Documentation

## Overview
Task Magic provides a structured, file-based workflow for managing plans, tasks, and project memory using AI agents like Cursor and Windsurf.

## Workflow Steps
1. **Initialize `.ai/` structure**: Create plans, tasks, and memory directories as needed.
2. **Create a plan**: Use planning rules to define project or feature requirements.
3. **Generate tasks**: Break down plans into actionable tasks using task rules.
4. **Work on tasks**: Update task status and details as work progresses.
5. **Archive**: Move completed/failed tasks and old plans to memory for historical reference.

## Best Practices
- Use @-tags to reference specific rules in prompts.
- Keep plans and tasks up to date for optimal AI agent performance.
- Periodically archive completed work to maintain clarity and context.
